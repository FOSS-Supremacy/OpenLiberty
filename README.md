# OpenLiberty - GTA 3 in Godot

This project aims to reimplement the GTA 3 on the Godot Engine.

Currently, this project is able to load the game's map, collision data, etc. at
runtime and stream in models and textures as needed.

**This repository doesn't contain GTA3 code or files**

## What It Not Is?

It's not a 1:1 reimplementation because GTA3 is complex and old, the RenderWare formats needs to be converted to Godot which already is a lot of work.

The story mode is also very complex and time consuming to implement.

## How It Works?

The Godot engine loads the GTA3 files at execution by converting them from GTA3 file formats to Godot formats, this conversion is very fast and don't reduce performance.

## Motivation

Currently there's two open-source reimplementations of GTA3:

- [re3](https://github.com/halpz/re3) - It had legal problems due to Rockstar Games code.
- [OpenRW](https://openrw.org/) - Incomplete and not active.

Both projects use the [RenderWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare) version of GTA3, which is old and limited for improvements.

Our project is more safe to work because we don't use Rockstar Games code, just the GTA3 files that the user needs to add on the project folder.

Beyond legal safety, the RenderWare version used on the GTA3 is old and technically limited for improvements. While the Godot Engine is modern and much more advanced, also easier to make contributions.

## Probable Future

If we successfully load most GTA3 formats, we could start a GTA San Andreas reimplementation on the Godot engine.

Why? because the GTA San Andreas formats are an evolution of the GTA3 formats, thus part of the GTA3 format converter code can be reused.

Similar to what the [San Andreas Unity](https://github.com/in0finite/SanAndreasUnity) project did, but the Unity engine is closed-source and proprietary.

## Why Godot?

The Godot engine allows you to save a lot of time in development because of the node system, where the relationship between the game components is very easily and fast to implement things.

Also because of GDScript, the Godot scripting language allows you to write less code to implement things.

- Space - Play/Pause music
- = - Increase the music volume
- - - Decrease the music volume
- N - Enable the night
- F - Enable full-screen

## TODOs

- [ ] Properly verify if the GTA3 files are present before execution
- [ ] Configure the player model and texture on the map
- [ ] Load the vehicles
- [ ] Load the weapons
- [ ] Load the NPCs
- [ ] Load the animations
- [ ] Add controls on the player
- [x] Add controls on vehicles
- [ ] Configure the weapons
- [ ] Add Day and Night cycle
- [x] Add shadows
- [ ] Add rain
- [x] Add the Sun on the sky
- [ ] Add the Moon on the sky
- [ ] Support modding
- [ ] Multiplayer (WIP, almost working)

## Overhaul TODOs

### RenderWare addon

- [ ] Harden the generic RenderWare chunk walker and loader error handling.
- [ ] Document the public resource and instance APIs so the addon can be used by other projects.

### Project asset resources

- [x] Convert the GTA collision parser into a `CollisionData : Resource`.
- [x] Add a project-level `.col` `ResourceFormatLoader` with validated parsing and case-insensitive model lookup.
- [x] Add a `CollisionInstance : StaticBody3D` that builds box, sphere, and triangle collision shapes from a collision model.
- [x] Replace `MapData` collision construction with `CollisionInstance` nodes.
- [ ] Add focused test scenes for COL loading and collision geometry.

### Map and asset assembly

- [ ] Extract a project-level asset resolver/registry for item definitions, DFFs, TXDs, and COLs after their resource boundaries are stable.
- [ ] Move model, texture, collision, and placement construction out of `MapData` into focused components.
- [ ] Add explicit diagnostics for missing files, duplicate definitions, malformed records, and unknown object IDs.
- [ ] Parse `ZONE` sections from `.zon` and `.ipl` files.
- [ ] Add a zone system that tracks the active gameplay and island zones.
- [ ] Use type 3 island zones and their level values to control island asset visibility/loading.
- [ ] Integrate zone state with `IslandLOD*` model handling.

### World runtime

- [ ] Keep render, collision, and effects activation independent when building placement instances.
